## Visibility & Access Control

### Teachers (scope='mine'):
- ✅ Limited to passes from their assigned grades (via teacher_grade_map)
- ✅ Also includes passes they personally issued (regardless of grade)
- ✅ Automatic scope detection based on user role

### Admins (scope='school'):
- ✅ Full school access with all filters available
- ✅ Can filter by any grade, teacher, or pass type
- ✅ Automatic scope elevation for admin/superadmin roles

## Duration Calculation

✅ **Smart Duration Logic**: `COALESCE(ends_at, NOW()) - starts_at`
- Active passes use current time as end time for duration calculation
- Returned passes use actual end time
- Duration calculated in minutes and rounded appropriately

## Features Implemented

✅ **Date Range Filtering**: Flexible from/to date parameters
✅ **Grade Filtering**: Filter by specific grade ID  
✅ **Teacher Filtering**: Filter by specific teacher ID
✅ **Pass Type Filtering**: Filter by pass type
✅ **Peak Hour Analysis**: Identifies busiest hour of the day
✅ **Comprehensive Statistics**: Totals, averages, and breakdowns
✅ **CSV Export**: Direct streaming download with proper formatting
✅ **Access Control**: Role-based visibility with teacher grade restrictions
✅ **Error Handling**: Validation for all parameters with clear error messages

## Test Results

✅ **Authentication Required**: Both endpoints properly require authentication
✅ **Role-Based Access**: Teachers see limited scope, admins see full school
✅ **Parameter Validation**: Invalid dates and IDs return proper 400 errors  
✅ **CSV Streaming**: Export endpoint streams data efficiently

The reports system is now fully functional and ready for daily/weekly/custom reporting workflows!
